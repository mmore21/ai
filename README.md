# Python Machine Learning Algorithms
Popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. These implementations are based upon Andrew Ng's Coursera course on machine learning. The presented mathematical intuition and formulas along with the Octave exercises presented throughout the course were used as the fundamental guidelines to implementing these algorithms.

### Algorithms
The following algorithms were implemented:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network

### Libraries
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scipy

### Examples
Each of these algorithms includes the example dataset that the Coursera course uses. Simply clone this folder and run the respective script to see a demo of the algorithm.
