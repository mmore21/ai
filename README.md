# Artificial Intelligence Notebooks

Popular AI algorithms implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

These implementations are based upon the mathematical theory in Andrew Ng's Coursera specializations and UC Irvine's AI courses.

### Libraries

* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2 / Keras
* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib

### Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented:
* Linear Regression
