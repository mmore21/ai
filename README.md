# Artificial Intelligence Notebooks

Popular AI algorithms implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

These implementations are based upon the mathematical theory in Andrew Ng's Coursera specializations and UC Irvine's AI courses.

### Libraries

* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2 / Keras
* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib

### Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Neural Network

### Architecture

The following architectures are implemented:
* Residual Neural Network (ResNet)
* U-Net
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

### Roadmap

As time permits, the following algorithms and architectures to be implemented include:
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Neural Style Transfer CNN

Also, there is the possibility of writing a simple deep learning library for educational purposes.
