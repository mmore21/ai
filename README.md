# Artificial Intelligence Notebooks
Popular AI algorithms implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

These implementations are based upon the mathematical theory in Andrew Ng's Coursera specializations and UC Irvine's AI courses.

### Libraries
* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2 / Keras

### Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification
* Shallow Neural Network

### Future Algorithms
As time permits, the following algorithms to be added include:
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Neural Style Transfer CNN
