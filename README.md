# Python Machine Learning Algorithms
Popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. These 
implementations are based upon Andrew Ng's Coursera course on machine 
learning. The presented mathematical intuition and formulas along with 
the Octave exercises presented throughout the course were used as the 
fundamental guidelines to implementing these algorithms. Inspiration for 
some of the newer algorithms come from university courses at 
UCI.

### Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification

### Libraries
* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas
* SciPy

### Examples
These algorithms include the example datasets that the Coursera course uses. Simply clone this folder and run the respective script to see a demo of the algorithm.
